SPREADSHEET+OPENREFINE


PRO
*Really interesting and useful

*Very Practice oriented, some really usefull stuff
*Good intro to Open Refine and quality control in Excel, Good Pace

*The many Open Refine exercises
*Open Refine is really Usefull
*Very good structure and teaching schedule
*Really cool stuff about Openrefine
*Really great intro to spreadsheet and Openrefine. Definetely somethin I will use in the future. Great to have exercises throughout so I can see how everything works and the problems can pick up alog the way
*Lots of practice with Open Refine
*Cleaning Data so good to know OpenRefine

CONTRO HOW TO IMPROVE
*Maybe sit the people not using excel together since they would have similar issues
*First sectionon excel a bit too long for the amount of content
*1/2 hours at the beginning to check all software download and working
*Excel a little bit too static
*More practice with Excel
*More cleaning setting and pipelines in Openrefine
*Excel pretty dry
*nothing
*Adding a session on different functions and why to organise the raw data in more detail in spreadsheet
*More pre-course intro 
*Disproportionally paced. Intro to spreadsheets felt drawn out as very basic whereas OpenRefine was too rushed sometimes
*scatterplot still a little bit confused 
*Pace a little slow
*Some more info on data Safety on OpenRefine

PYTHON

PRO
*Really nice Python work
*Covered a fairly large range of issues for Python, Good pace, Useful to be able to use jupyter and anaconda ratehr than needing to use a comand line
*Good one to one support, easy to follow
*Pace was good, very helpful stuff
*I really appreciate the help provided. I had a problem and they did not stop till they found a solution
*Very useful
*better that the issues mean we have each using in our own jupyter notebook, otherwise difficult to get back after class

CONTRO HOW TO IMPROVE
*would work nicer with live coding instead of walking through
*Did not go until much detail for absolute beginners, would have been good to know how to export plot
*Python class went well. It was a bit hard to type and listen to the explanations at the same time but learnt a lot of things
*Would have lile to have programmed some stats on data e.g. regression
*Just more time larger course
*nothing to change. Really helpful step by step
*Sometimes too quick, missed a couple of things
*Need a more fundamental introduction to coding etc. I only keep up because I did an R training session last week

CONTRO HOW TO IMPROVE
*Not easy to see the SQL Queries on the screen when the ppt on. Need a double screen

*Maybe link to good SLQ learning sources
*More on joining 
*More challenges
*Need double screen to have ppt and SQL query together
